# Selenium script which gives most freqeuntly asked question on stackoverflow for particular tag on particular year
Problem statement:
<ul>
<li>Go to the site 'stackoverflow.com'. </li>
<li>Search for particular tag. </li>
<li>From list of results, find outthe tag name which was asked for max number of times in the current year.</li>
<li>Print the tagname.</li>
<li>Also the count of times it is asked.</li>
</ul>

In this script I've used year = 2016 and tag = 'qa'
